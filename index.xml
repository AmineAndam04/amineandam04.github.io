      <description>The VDN paper presents an algorithm to solve cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with common rewards (team reward). In this settings, several agents are working together to maximise the (discounted) future rewards. Each agent receive a local obervation ( partial-observabiliy) that helps him take apropriate actions. It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that the VDN algorithm considers only discrete actions.
The cooperative MARL problem can be solved using single-agent RL algorithms such as DQN or PPO by considering a single-agent whoses state space is the contatenated state of the agents and an action space that is the combination of the action spaces of the agents.</description>
